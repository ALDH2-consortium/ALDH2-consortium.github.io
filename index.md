# ALDH2 Consortium
Welcome to the *ALDH2* Consortium website. This consortium is being conducted by researchers at the MRC IEU at the University of Bristol, led by Professor George Davey Smith. Briefly, the aim of this consortium is to investigate three key questions related to *ALDH2*.

## Aims and Objectives:

**(1) Examine the potential causal effect of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on risk of pregnancy complications and adverse offspring health using Mendelian randomization.** 

**(2) Investigate the interaction between maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and *ALDH2* genotype *(maternal and child)*, on pregnancy and offspring outcomes.** 

**(3) Investigate the role of *ALDH2* genotype on risk and severity of infectious diseases.**

## Potential Impact
Findings from this project could have critical public health implications as ALDH2*2 is highly prevalent and many women of reproductive age are consuming alcohol (Li et al., 2009; Popova et al., 2017). ALDH2*2 is highly prevalent in Japan (~30%), China (~40%), South Korea (~25%), Vietnam and Cambodia (~15%) (Li et al., 2009). Moreover, many women are consuming alcohol during pregnancy (prevalence ranges from 6.5 to 21.4% in the countries above) (Popova et al., 2017). It is also important to consider that maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is likely under-reported (due to stigma and unawareness of pregnancy in early stages) and may increase postnatally during breastfeeding. Therefore, this is a pressing research question that promptly needs to be addressed.

## Current status
To acheive these aims, we are inviting researchers working with cohorts in East and Southeast Asia to join the Consortium. This Consortium, and it's specific aims and details, are still being established. As soon as a draft protocol is ready, this will be made available here. In the meantime, for some more information please visit the 'About the ALDH2 Consortium' tab on this page.
