# ALDH2 Consortium
Welcome to the ALDH2 Consortium website. This consortium is being conducted by researchers at the MRC IEU at the University of Bristol, led by Professor George Davey Smith. Briefly, the aim of this consortium is to address three key questions related to ALDH2.

Aims:
(1) Examine the potential causal effect of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on risk of pregnancy complications and adverse offspring health using Mendelian randomization. 
(2) Investigate the interaction between maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and ALDH2 genotype (maternal and child), on pregnancy and offspring outcomes. 
(3) Investigate the role of ALDH2 genotype on risk and severity of infectious diseases.

To acheive these aims, we are inviting researchers working with cohorts in East and Southeast Asia to join the Consortium. This Consortium, and it's specific aims and details, are still being established. As soon as a draft protocol is ready, this will be made available here. In the meantime, for some more information please visit the 'About' tab on this page.

For further information, or if you are interested in contributing to this Consortium, please contact chloe.slaney@bristol.ac.uk.
