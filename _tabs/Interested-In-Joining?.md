# How To Get Involved
If you are a researcher working with, or leading, a cohort in East or Southeast Asia (e.g., Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Cambodia) and you are interested in joining this Consortium, please email chloe.slaney@bristol.ac.uk. 

**NOTE: To be involved, cohorts are required to have *ALDH2* genotype data available and phenotype data for at least 1 of 3 key aims (listed below)**. 

## Data Required:
### Aim 1: Examine the potential *causal* effect of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on risk of pregnancy complications and adverse offspring health using Mendelian randomization. 

**Necessary Data: Only maternal *ALDH2* genotype data is necessary, along with 1+ phenotype below.**

### Aim 2: Investigate the interaction between maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and *ALDH2* genotype (maternal and child), on pregnancy and offspring outcomes. 

**Necessary Data: Maternal and/or child *ALDH2* genotype data is necessary, information on maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, and 1+ phenotype(s) (listed above).** 

### Aim 3: Investigate the role of *ALDH2* genotype on risk (and if available, severity) of infectious disease. 

**Necessary data: *ALDH2* genotype on any cohort participants with infection data are required**. For a list of infectious diseases and severity we are considering, please see below. However, we are also considering other diseases, so please do check with us if they could be included.
