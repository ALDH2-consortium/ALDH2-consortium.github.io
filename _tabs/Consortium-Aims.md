### Aim 1: Examine the potential causal effect of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on risk of pregnancy complications and adverse offspring health using Mendelian randomization (MR).
Determining whether maternal alcohol use causes adverse offspring outcomes is challenging due to potential confounding (e.g., maternal smoking and diet). MR can overcome this challenge by using genetic variants robustly associated with alcohol use as a proxy. Maternal *ALDH2\*2* homozygosity provides an ideal proxy for “no drinking” (as few women with this genotype will consume alcohol). If alcohol is causal, we would expect reduced risk of adverse offspring outcomes in ALDH2 homozygote mothers, compared with *ALDH2\*1* homozygotes.

### Aim 2: Investigate the interaction between maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and *ALDH2* genotype (maternal and child), on pregnancy and offspring outcomes.
Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy may cause adverse outcomes for the mother and offspring (e.g., miscarriage, impaired neurodevelopment), and these effects could be mediated by acetaldehyde, a highly toxic by-product of alcohol metabolism. Crucially, this problem may be substantially magnified in East and Southeast Asian countries due to the high prevalence of the *ALDH2\*2* allele (up to 40% in these populations), which causes increased acetaldehyde levels following alcohol consumption. The *ALDH2* gene encodes the main enzyme responsible for eliminating acetaldehyde.

We recently wrote a [short commentary](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acer.70070?af=R) on a paper by [Miyake et al. (2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11740163/) partly looking at this using data from a Japanese birth cohort which reported extremely large effects on risk of adverse offspring outcomes (odds ratios ~10+). However, given the wide confidence intervals in this paper (due to the small sample size), this needs to be tested in a larger sample. In this Consortium, we will increase statistical power by meta-analysing data across many East and Southeast Asian cohorts, and address key outstanding questions that still need to be addressed. For the list of phenotypes of interest, please see the 'How to Get Involved' tab.

### Aim 3: Investigate the role of *ALDH2* genotype on risk and severity of infectious diseases.
Despite potential adverse effects of *ALDH2\*2* on risk of adverse health outcomes following alcohol consumption (e.g., esophageal cancer, offspring development), it has been favourably selected over the past 2000-3000 years. One proposed theory is that *ALDH2\*2* may reduce risk and/or severity of infectious disease (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis B), due to acetaldehyde being toxic to infectious agents.
