Welcome to the ALDH2 Consortium website. This consortium is being conducted by the MRC IEU at the University of Bristol, led by Prof. George Davey Smith. Briefly, the aim of this consortium is to address key questions related to ALDH2, specifically: (1) Interaction between maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and ALDH2 genotype (maternal and child), on pregnancy and offspring outcomes. (2) Role of ALDH2 on risk and severity of infectious diseases. To acheive this, the consortium will comprise data from cohorts in East and Southeast Asia. As soon as a draft protocol is ready, this will be made available here.

For further information, or if you are interested in contributing to this consortium, please contact chloe.slaney@bristol.ac.uk.
